1. Use `unkown` for a type you plan to narrow later (or for just equality & boolean ops like ===, ||, etc.)
2. Typescript can infer _specific types_ like true or false, not just boolean: These are called _type literals_.
3. Tupescript supports numeric separators like: let oneMillion = 1_000_000 // Equivalent to 1000000

        <p>Hopniss (<dfn>Apios Americana</dfn>) is a plant with a list of colloquial names almost as long as its storied history: Groundnut (but in the UK sources suggest that &ldquo;groundnut&rdquo; is used more commonly to refer to what we call a &ldquo;peanut&rdquo; in the U.S.), Hodoimo, Indian Potato and Potato Bean.</p>

        <p>The tuber of this plant has generally been described as having a taste that is something like a cross between a peanut and a potato - and several culinary references for the Hopniss plant suggest that, for the most part,it can be used interchangeably with its legumic cousin in recipes.  Hopniss compare favorably to potatoes both in taste and nutritional profile - reportedly boasting 3 times the protein of potatoes by weight.</p>

        <h2>Storied Past &amp; Hope for the Future</h2>
        <p>Hopniss is one of the most important plants in America's history - and may be one of the most important plants in its future.  Stigmatized as an &ldquo;Indian Crop&rdquo; and later abandoned by the same European colonists it sustained through their early years in the U.S., hopniss is more nutritious (3x protein, 10x calcium) and more tolerant of adverse growing conditions than its more well-known cousin the potato - and many of the lucky few modern Americans who have tasted it believe it has a better flavor as well.  These factors point to a future where hopniss may play a vital role in solving hunger and crop biodiversity issues. Hopniss is an ideal introduction to the joys and benefits of eating and raising undercultivated plants/vegetables because it is relatively easy to find and cultivate throughout much of the U.S.</p>

    <h2>Caution</h2>
        <p>There are some reports of hopniss triggering an allergic reaction in a small minority of people, but no clear documented cases or information pertaining to that (and it's possible that those reports come from its common name &ldquo;groundnut&rdquo; being confused with in the U.K. with &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; as we call them in the U.S.).  Nevertheless - as is always the case when introducing undercultivated foods to one's diet - it should be done in moderation at first and other individual health factors like nut allergies, etc. should be considered.</p>
        <p>If you decide to forage for hopniss - as with any foraging activity - it is extremely important to find an expert to help you with positive identification before you attempt to harvest, prepare or consume the plant.  Check out our foraging guides page for suggestions.</p>
        <p>Do not eat raw hopniss tubers as they may contain a <a>mildly toxic amino acid</a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apios_americana#cite_note-Johnson-4"> that is broken down when cooked.</p>

        <h2>Foraging for Hopniss</h2>
        <p>Hopniss generally grows in wet, sandy but well-drained soils - often on river banks.  It ranges throughout the Eastern US (it is suggested generally East of Colorado) and Southeastern Canada.  Above ground, it can be identified by its prolific vine and maroon or reddish-brown flowers.  When unearthed, it yields its characteristic "string of beads" tubers (the most popular part of the the plant to prepare - although it is said that the seeds can be eaten as well).  To get the plant's tubers, simply dig at the base of the vine to pull up the "string of beads".</p>

        <h2>Cultivating Hopniss</h2>
        <p>When planted in a permaculture setup, hopniss prefers to be next to a taller sturdier plant that its vines (which can extend up to 10 feet) can use as a trellis.  For that purpose, many suggest cultivating it in pairs with Jerusalem Artichokes or small fruit-bearing bushes.  Otherwise, you should provide and artificial trellis for the vines to ascend.  According to some sources, a study at the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge bred some cultivars that produced much larger tubers than wild hopniss.  We're trying to locate those - contact us if you have any details.</p>

        <h2>Preparing and Cooking Hopniss</h2>
        <p>Generally, hopniss tubers can be substituted for potatoes in most recipes.  According to the <a href="https://orionmagazine.org/article/stalking-the-wild-groundnut/">article that provided the inspiration for this site</a>, tasty results can be achieved by boiling, peeling and then slow-cooking them with a half-stick of butter and some maple syrup.  The foragerchef.com 's Alan Bergo (<a href="http://foragerchef.com/hunt-for-the-hopniss/">check it out</a>) also suggests simmering for about 10 minutes with stock and then thickening it with butter.
